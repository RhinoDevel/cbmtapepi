- Pi:  Starts infinite send loop:

       SENSE -> LOW  (at CBM)
       - send HIGH-to-LOW (at CBM) pulses to transfer data while stopping (see
         details in code) under some circumstances, if CBM set MOTOR to LOW -
       SENSE -> HIGH (at CBM)
       READ  -> HIGH (at CBM)
       
       - next iteration -

- CBM: LOADs data from READ:

       May disables the MOTOR signal in-between (normally after the header data
       is retrieved).
       Should set MOTOR signal to low when ready, even if SENSE is still LOW
       (at CBM) (not sure, if all CBMs do that).

!!! There may be just a very short time between load above and wedge installer
    run below, because (at least on some CBMs) you can use RUN key to trigger
    LOAD and immediate RUN command execution after loading.

- CBM: Executes loaded wedge installer:

       - toggle WRITE signal for some time (with a frequency that is much higher
         than the "toggle" frequency used by VIC's ISR for keyboard scan) to
         indicate to the Pi, that the fast mode wedge is installed -

- Pi:  Detect fast-mode-is-installed signal & break send loop:

       When the signal from CBM is detected:
       SENSE -> HIGH (at CBM)
       READ  -> HIGH (at CBM)
       - enter fast-mode -
       - wait for MOTOR line to get LOW -
       - wait for MOTOR line to get HIGH (will indicate data-ready-from-CBM) -

!!! REMEMBER: The CBM (itself and in combination with the hardware interface)
              does not necessarily toggle from HIGH to LOW and vice versa fast
              enough to meet the requirements of the Pi.

              => We must take care of that problem in software.
